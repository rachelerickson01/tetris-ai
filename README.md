# Overview

This objective of this project is to create an AI tetris player in JavaScript. Initially, the goal will be to create the tetris game itself to be played in a browser. 

## Current State

The project currently contains three files:
- index.html (which provides the initial structure for the browser page)
- style.css (which allows for styling of the webpage, currently just formatting text and colors of the grid)
- app.js (the main game logic file, which currently implements an event listener and creates an array of the grid squares)
